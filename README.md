# odin-recipes
In this project I will build a webpage using my previous knowledge.
Firstly I need to set up a initial structure creating an index.html file and filling it out with the usual boilerplate HTML.
Secondly I will create a Recipe page in which I will code just a simple heading and a add this page to the Index page.
Then I will have to add some content to the Recipe page, an image of the finish dish, a description of the image, a list of the ingredients, and the steps. Lastly, adding two more pages for other two recipes.
